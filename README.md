# Movie Data Analysis

With the proposition of starting a new movie studio, I looked to evaluate how different genres compare in regards to the return of investment

# Data

Joined two datasets, the first was from IMDB.com, contaning qualitative factors like name, genre, and release date 

The second contained quantitative data for budget and box office gross 

# Data Cleaning and Manipulation

Created a function to remove uneeded symbols like ( , and $ )

Converted columns to the correct data type

Converted exponential values to whole numbers

Created new columns for profit and return of investment

Removed outliers in gross and ROI columns

Split Genre column, creating single entries of genre per row

# Findings

Genres with the highest average return of investment:

Horror - 572%
Mystery - 504%
Musical - 467%
